# career-journal-template
A template for creating a repo that tracks career progress and has an issue template for 1:1s 


## Repo Tour
Ultimately, all of this is yours, so do what feels right for you with organization and process, but below you'll see my thoughts on each section and the motivation behind them.

### Resources
This folder contains a write-up on how to best approach goal setting. In the future I may add more documents to this folder and if you have already used the repo as a template, will send those over to you to add. I also encourage you to add anything you find useful and want to be able to refer back to into that folder for later reference.

### Goals
This folder contains a list of your personal quals per quarter with the naming convention of `YYYY-QQ.md`. Around the time of each quarter ending, we will review the previous quarter's goals and I will ask you to prepare a PR with the goals for the next quarter. _I never want this goal setting and tracking process to feel like useless busy work, micromanagement, or a source of anxiety. If you find any of those things happening, reach out and we can make adjustments to suit your needs and career goals._

### Issues
There is an issue template setup already, the goal is that you will open a new issue before our 1:1 and fill out all the parts that seem relevant to our discussion. I will take notes during that chat and we can continue the conversation afterwards on that issue. As the next 1:1 approaches, you will close the previous one and open a new one.

### Motiviation (Goals for this repo)
I want to see you succeed in your career, to whatever definition of success it is that you hold. This repo is a way of giving us both something tangible to hold onto to work towards those goals. 
- By having this repo owned by you, it goes with you between team changes, reorgs, and manager changes, so the history cannot be lost in someone's google drive.
- By having a predictable format of issues for each 1:1:
  - It is easier for you and myself to look over past wins at review time.
  - Long running asks are easy to keep an eye on.
  - Frustrations and other pain points can be reviewed later.
